I'm currently a 4th year student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Computer Science.

I enjoy writing clean, mainatainable code and have had the privilege to work on some really cool products at some really cool places!
  * A productivity tool for generating customized sales pitches at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com)
  * A feature to split bills for [MintChip](https://www.mintchip.ca)
  * A complete revamp of the web application at [CanadaStays](https:/www.canadastays.com) with React

Apart from that, I love exploring different parts of our planet Earth, especially places off the beaten track.
This is me lost on top of Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa.

I'm constantly looking for opportunities to work on a cool software engineering project, or to get lost in a city with a name I can barely pronounce. If you'd like to reach out, do feel free to email me at m45yang@uwaterloo.ca!
