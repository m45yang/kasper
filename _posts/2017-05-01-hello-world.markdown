The mind is a fickle thing; it barely remembers what happened a week ago, much less a year ago. Not being able to recall what I have seen and learned about disturbs me, especially when my life is going through constant change. So I've decided to start a personal website as an effort to record important life events, like how Albus Dumbledore recorded his thoughts in a Pensieve.

Hope my future self enjoys reading these articles.
